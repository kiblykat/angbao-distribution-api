# ðŸ’Œ Angbao Distribution API

## Preamble

This project communicates with a mongodb database to distribute a random amount of money to multiple people. For easy access to the database to public without exposing sensitive environment variables, I have hosted the app is hosted on vercel. I have included endpoints for user creation and deletion as well for increased accessibility. Postman will be used to test the endpoints. The github repository can be found here: https://github.com/kiblykat/angbao-distribution-api.

Note: Money is stored in cents to prevent floating point conversion issues.
