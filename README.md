### Problem statement: Chinese Red Envelopes

---

In Chinese culture, it is popular to offer red envelopes (Angpao) for Chinese New Year. This beloved tradition has been going on for centuries.
However, in the past few years, red envelopes have been moved into popular mobile phone applications. In addition to the traditional red envelope gifts,
a popular mobile game has emerged: families use services such as WeChat group red packets to distribute digital red envelopes to a group of family members or friends.
Money is distributed randomly to a group of friends or family members and people are excited to see the results.

### Scenario:

---

User A wants to share $10 among 5 different friends. The algorithm randomly attributes part of the amount to each of the participants:
<br/>
<br/>B: $1
<br/>C: $4
<br/>D: $3
<br/>E: $0.5
<br/>F: $1.5
<br/><br/>
In that case, each of the participants receives money in their wallet and user C is the one who receives the most money.

### Instructions

---

Your goal is to write a program that:
<br/> 1. **Randomly allocates a set amount of money to a set number of participants**.
<br /> 2. **Using automated Unit Testing, you should show that your algorithm behaves properly in multiple scenarios.**
<br /> 3. **Use any practices that you would recommend to your peers** such as clean code principles, linting, clear git commit messages, etc.
<br/> 4. **Write Setup Instructions in README** after you are done!

<br/>The challenge might be done in any language you are proficient in.
